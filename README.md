Dev & Production system require:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (Engine & Compose) (v2+)
- Node (Pref v4+)
- Npm (Pref v3+)

## Usage

Now simply a helper tool to distribute swarms to hosts based on a config file (for now).  

Was used to house DB administration tools, deployment tools, project management tools.  

Required too much dependency on a single node module. That doesn't fit with a
micro services architecture and multiple languages, where node is required for projects.  

See <strong>[kc-configs](https://bitbucket.org/JestrJ/kc-configs.git)</strong> for such tools that were extracted from this module into a bash script (which it was originally converted from a bash script, and needs to be modularized)
